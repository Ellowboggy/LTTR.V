Have you ever witnessed the moon blushing a crimson, caught in the gaze of the sun? That's how my heart raced, concealed within your shadows; your laughter reverberated like an echo within my soul.
-'Umbrasuscitated' (Mar 25, 2023)

I truly saw you beyond the surface appearance. I saw the stories etched in the lines around your eyes. Heard the whispers contained within your sighs. Understanding blossomed like wildfire consuming all logic and leaving behind smoldering embers of truth.
-'Veritaseye' (May 26, 2023)

Love is akin to a rose with thorns—exquisite a force that endures storms amidst our silent moments together. I observed where the thorns kissed your skin and witnessed drops of blood emerge; nevertheless you clung onto its stem with my name whispered upon your lips.
-'Susurrisanguine' (Aug 26,2023)

We danced amidst flames, with ashes swirling through our hair that this love—ephemeral yet fiercely burning—was an invaluable treasure confined to borrowed instances.
-'Cinderwalt' (Nov 26,2023)

So let these words spill out untidily and unabashedly—a love etched in scars, not flaws, but rather engraved upon the scars of reality.
I want you to know that no matter what happens, even if everything falls apart, I love and will continue understand you with a fearless passion.
